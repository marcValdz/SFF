SteaMidra helps you set up games to work with Steam using Lua scripts, manifests, and LumaCore. It writes the right files into your Steam folder so games and DLC can run. It does not replace or crack Steam itself.

## Features

- Download and use Lua files for games, download manifests, and set up LumaCore.
- Write Lua and manifest data into Steam's config.
- **LC Online Fix** — toggle `-onlinefix` on a chosen App ID in `localconfig.vdf`. Closes Steam first, picks the active SteamID3 from `loginusers.vdf`, navigates the VDF tree case-insensitively. LumaCore handles the appid-480 redirect at launch so the overlay, Steam Input, and screenshots still tag the real game.
- **Multiplayer Fix** — downloads and applies multiplayer patches from **online-fix.me** straight into the game folder. Requires an online-fix.me account.
- **Fixes & Bypasses** — searches a curated list from the CrakFiles repo on GitHub and applies the chosen fix to the game folder. No API key, no account. Achievement-safe — only adds bypass DLLs, leaves the Steam API intact.
- **HyperVisor Cracks (HV Auto)** — download HyperVisor bypasses for Denuvo-protected games. Includes VBS.cmd to prepare your system. See the [HyperVisor Guide](docs/HV_GUIDE.md) before use.
- DLC status check, cracking (gbe_fork), SteamStub DRM removal (Steamless), and DLC Unlockers (CreamInstaller-style: SmokeAPI, CreamAPI, Uplay).
- **Multi-language GUI** — English and Portuguese built-in; add more via `sff/locales/`.
- Parallel downloads, backups, recent files, and settings export/import.
- **Linux support** — SLSSteam ID management, platform-aware MIDI, and Linux-compatible auto-update.
- **Store tab** — ⭐ **THIS IS THE MAIN WAY TO DOWNLOAD GAMES.** browse Hubcap's manifest library to find games and download either using the Steam download function for downloading latest versions very quick or **older or specific versions** of a game via DepotDownloaderMod (.NET 9 required, slower). Use this **only** when you need a specific older version of a game, not the latest.
- **Main tab "Download Game"** — Downloads the **latest version** of a game directly from Steam (fast, no .NET required for Windows OS). Processes the Lua file, writes decryption keys, copies the Lua to `config/stplug-in/` and the manifests to `depotcache/` so LumaCore picks the game up immediately, then triggers Steam to download the game files natively. Use this for 99% of games.

## Quick start

### Step 1: SteaMidra

Download the latest installer from [here](https://github.com/Midrags/SFF/releases/latest) and run it. The installer auto-creates the install folder, sets up file associations, and registers the uninstaller.

If the installer fails or your AV blocks it, grab the ZIP instead — `SteaMidra-x.x.x-windows.zip`. Extract anywhere, run `SteaMidra_GUI.exe` from inside the extracted folder.

**Do not run SteaMidra yet.** Complete Steps 2 and 3 first so all folders exist before first launch.

### Step 2: LumaCore

Open SteaMidra, go to the **Home** tab, click **Auto LC Setup**, then click **Install LumaCore**. SteaMidra downloads the latest LumaCore release from GitHub and installs `dwmapi.dll` + `LumaCore.dll` into the Steam folder, removing old GreenLuma files automatically.

If the install fails, ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/V8aZqnbB84).

### Step 3: Launch Steam

Run `SteaMidra_GUI.exe` and add a game on the Home tab. LumaCore makes it appear in the Steam library immediately. See the [User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md) for how to add games.

> Running from source (Python)? See the [Python Setup Guide](docs/PYTHON_SETUP.md).

---

## Linux quick start

LumaCore is a Steam-client DLL hijack and is **Windows-only**. On Linux, SteaMidra uses **SLSsteam** (license/family-share injection) plus **SLScheevo** (achievement-only Steam client) instead. Manifests, depot keys, and ACFs work the same as on Windows.

### Step 1: Download the Linux build

Grab `SteaMidra-x.x.x-linux.zip` (or the AppImage) from the [releases page](https://github.com/Midrags/SFF/releases/latest) and extract it. CachyOS, Arch, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Steam Deck Desktop Mode are all supported.

### Step 2: Set up SLSsteam + SLScheevo

Launch SteaMidra, open **Quick Tools**, run **Set up Linux tools (SLSsteam + .NET 9)**. SteaMidra installs SLSsteam into `~/.steam/steam/` (or whichever Steam install it found), drops `SLSteam.so` and `library-inject.so`, and verifies your `.NET 9` runtime is on PATH (DepotDownloaderMod needs it).

If the GUI reports `SLSteam libraries not found: SLSteam.so, library-inject.so`, the install step has not run yet — open Quick Tools and run it.

### Step 3: Add a game

Add a game on the Home tab the same way as Windows. SteaMidra writes the lua to `config/stplug-in/`, drops the manifests, registers depot keys, and writes the ACF. **Restart Steam from inside SteaMidra** so SLSsteam injects into the new Steam process — without injection, ownership and family bypass do not work.

For the full walkthrough (supported distros, troubleshooting, what files go where, Steam-Deck-specific notes), see [docs/LINUX_SETUP.md](docs/LINUX_SETUP.md).

## GUI features

SteaMidra has a full graphical interface with a **Modern UI (new in 5.5.0, updated in 6.0.0)** and the classic Qt interface.

**Modern UI** — the new default interface, built with QWebEngine. Accessible from a clean sidebar with 8 tabs: Home (game picker with auto-refresh), Store (search/browse Hubcap, grid/list, pagination), Library (installed games), Downloads (live progress + history), Fix Game (full emulator pipeline), Tools (GBE Token Generator, VDF Extractor, Workshop), Cloud Saves (scan/backup/restore, Google Drive, rclone with 17 provider shortcuts, All Save Locations), and Settings. Supports 11+ themes, tooltips, and toast notifications.

**What the GUI gives you:**
- **Tabbed interface** — Main, Store, Downloads, Fix Game, Tools, and Cloud Saves tabs.
- Pick your game from a dropdown (all Steam libraries scanned) or set a path for games outside Steam.
- All actions as buttons: crack, DRM removal, DLC check, workshop items, multiplayer fix, **Fixes & Bypasses**, DLC unlockers, and more.
- **Store browser** — search and browse the Hubcap Manifest library with pagination. Download button opens a version picker with full depot/manifest history (SteamDB + GitHub mirror sources). **Force Refresh** button bypasses cache to re-scrape all historical manifests.
- **Fix Game pipeline** — automate emulator application (Goldberg, ColdClient, ColdLoader) with SteamStub unpacking.
- **GBE Token Generator** — generate full Goldberg emulator configs with achievements, DLCs, stats, and icons.
- **Cloud Saves** — Steam userdata save backup/restore. Scans `Steam/userdata/<steam32id>/` for all games with saves, back up and restore with one click (safety backup created automatically). Supports local folder, **Google Drive** (sign in once), and **rclone** (Dropbox, OneDrive, MEGA, S3, Backblaze B2, SFTP, and 70+ other backends — click a provider shortcut to pre-fill the remote format, then hit Setup in Terminal to configure it without leaving the app). **All Save Locations** scans every known emu save path (CODEX, EMPRESS, RUNE, OnlineFix, Goldberg, GSE, Steam userdata) and backs them all up in one operation.
- **VDF Key Extractor** — extract depot decryption keys from Steam's config.vdf.
- Lua/manifest processing and library tools all accessible from buttons.
- Full settings dialog where you can edit, delete, export, and import all settings.
- **11+ themes** including Dracula, Nord, Cyberpunk, and more.
- **System tray icon** for quick show/hide and exit.
- **Multi-language support** — switch between English and Portuguese in Settings (more locales can be added).
- **Log viewer** — "Logs" button in the menu bar (right of Help) opens a floating window showing all log output from every tab (Fix Game, Store, Tools, and more). Filterable by level (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR), with Clear and Copy All buttons.
- Any prompts that would normally appear in the terminal show up as dialog boxes instead.
